Linux
=====

To simply build and run

    $ make
    $ ./cashflo-qp


There is a rpm specfile that you can use to create an rpm, or just install
one of the pre-built packages.


Windows
=======

Under Linux, using the MinGW32 cross compiler tools, you can create a
Windows PE32 executable.

    $ ./mingw-make.sh

This will create a cashflo-qp.exe file that you can copy over to windows
along with the cashflo-qp.glade & README files. Put them all in the same
directory.

You will also need the Windows GTK3 runtime. While there is no official
release yet, you can grab a build from (grab the _runtime_ package).

This has been tested under WINE and in a Windows XP VM.
