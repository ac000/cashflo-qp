Overview
========

This is a very simple utility to show the difference between paying a supplier
after a longer number of days and earning interest on that or paying them
quicker in return for a discount.


How it Works
============

To do this, it needs six pieces of information.

    1) The amount. This would be the amount of the invoice.

    2) Interest Rate. This will just be a yearly rate.

    3) Interest Type. This is how the bank calculates the interest. It will
       be one of two ways.

	* EAR. This is the Effective Annual Rate. It is defined as;

			r = (1 + i/n)^n - 1

	       Where i is the nominal rate (aka APR) and n is the
	       compounding frequency.

	* APR. This is the Annual Percentage Rate. This can be defined in
	       terms of the EAR as:

			r = n * ((1 + EAR)^(1/n) - 1)

	See do_calc() for how these are actually calculated.

    4) Normal Payment Terms. This is how long you normally wait until you
       pay a supplier, in days.

    5) Quick Payment Terms. This is how long you have agreed to pay the
       supplier for a quick payment, in days.

    6) Supplier Discount. This is how much you'd get back from the supplier
       for quick payments as a percentage.

Given this information, it will then tell you how much interest you would
have lost over the period (Normal Payment Terms - Quick Payment Terms) for
the given amount.

It will tell you how much discount you would get from the supplier on that
amount for a quick payment.

Lastly it will work out at what point the interest lost and supplier
discount converge and give you this in days. For a given EAR it
can work this out exactly. For an APR it can approximate it to within a
day.


Caveats
=======

This will likely only work for UK banks.

It doesn't do anything special with leap years.
